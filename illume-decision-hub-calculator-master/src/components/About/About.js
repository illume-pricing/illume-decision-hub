                Currently, Jenny and Susan see many of their clients suffer through barriers to 
                making these informed decisions. Their clients are limited by convoluted financial 
                jargon, feeling overworked and underpaid, and having a lack of clear information.

                They see women business owners paying themselves less than men who own businesses, 
                clients burning themselves out with a lack of work life balance, and an overall lack 
                of confidence in making financial change.

              <li className="list-li">
                Jenny and Susan took on the challenge of simplifying the process by formulating 
                a dynamic tool to help clients make these educated business decisions, so that both 
                they and their clients could work less and earn more.

                The Illume Decision Hub addresses the challenge of handling unreadable spreadsheets by dynamically 
                collecting data that the user types in and uses it throughout their financial 
                calculation process.

              <li className="list-li">
                Using conversational language in tandem with help text, the application

              <li className="list-li">

              <li className="list-li">
